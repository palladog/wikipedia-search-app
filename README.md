# Wikipedia Search App

A JavaScript web app in which the user can Wikipedia search (using the Wikipedia API) and get a results page with 20 search results, each of which links to their Wikipedia articles. The user can also click the shuffle button, which sends them to a random Wikipedia article.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Contributions
This web app was made in accordance with Ayooluwa Isaiah's tutorial here: https://freshman.tech/wikipedia-javascript/.

Minor changes have been made to the design (it's not done yet though!)
